## Convolution : Matrix multiplication performed on input layer to be analyzed to store its specific/relevant information in another layer.

## Filters/Kernels : Extracts specific feature from an input component via scalar multiplication to hold unique information.

## Epochs : The number of times the convolution neural network visits the entire dataset.

## 1x1 Convolution : Method to extract prominent features required in a particular context and dropping the undesired metadata.

## 3x3 Convolution : A process to analyze 9 pixels at a time and storing the aggregated result(combined information) in a single number. 

## Feature Maps : Collection of features(each holding specific information) put together to form a full channel.

## Activation Function : Deciding function which determines the threshold if the weighted sum of inputs qualify for the next steps.

## Receptive Field : The number of pixels captured / area observed from input image relevant to the output image.
